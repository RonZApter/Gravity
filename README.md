# Particle and Gravity Simulations with SFML

This project contains several physics-based simulations implemented using C++ and SFML.  
It demonstrates gravitational interactions, particle collisions, atomic models, and various interesting visual patterns such as galaxies and spirals.

**Note:** This is my first experience working with C++.  
For this project, I studied Newton's laws of motion and gravity to better understand and implement the physics simulations.

## Features

- Binary Star Dance  
- Swirling Galaxy  
- Magnetic Spiral Chaos  
- Chaotic Spiral  
- Atoms Cloud Simulation  
- Lattice Pattern Simulation  
- Exploding Supernova  
- Orbital Ring  
- Galactic Collapse  
- Electric Dipole Oscillation  

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler  
- SFML library installed (version 2.5 recommended)  
- CMake or Visual Studio for building

## How to Build and Run

### Using Visual Studio

1. Open the solution file (.sln) or create a new Visual Studio project.  
2. Configure SFML dependencies.  
3. Build the solution.  
4. Run the executable.  
   You will be presented with a console menu to select which simulation to run.

### Using CMake (Linux/Mac/Windows)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./YourExecutableName
